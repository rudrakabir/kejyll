# Policy on AI usage
As of today, 21 Sep 2024, this is my statement of my usage of genAI tools/LLMs

I love using a lot of the new coolest AI tools, i really enjoyed using Suno, Midjourney, Cursor, Aider, ChatGPT, Claude.

Especially for quick research or intro to a new topic, Claude especially is amazing.

I have never and never will use AI to "write" for me. No email, text, or piece of my writing that I represent as Kabir is written by AI, nor do I want it to be. 

For me, writing is the way I think, the way I structure my ideas. The point of it is not the output or the finished piece, but the process itself, the journey I take from beginning to end to editing. 

I do use AI to code, and a lot of the code in my Projects is AI generated. I love it for that purpose, it is damn useful. For me, code is a means to an end, and I will use any tool possible to make the process easier. 

I do also use AI for feedback and inspiration, often, for example asking it to make random lists or writing prompts to spark my imagination, for which it is about as useful as a real life friend, perhaps more so because it's always available. 

The point of this is esssentially to say, nothing that I put out there as me is written by AI, and if I do make something that is, it will be with disclosure.
