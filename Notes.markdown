I am a big believer in the building in public philosophy, and I am learning how to write and express myself better. I want a place that I can freely experiment and iterate quickly, without fear of opinion on "finished work".

That thought resulted in my digital garden.

Here you will find my various musings and insights on a variety of topics that interest me.

Think of it as a lab, or a workshop, where stuff is still happening, and the outcome is stillâ€¦undetermined. All writing here is considered WIP, and living.
