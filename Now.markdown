# Website
I've been noodling about on this website as a live server on my local machine for a few months now, for no particular reason. I think I spent a couple weeks just making the same posts in different static site generators just to check it out. It's not done yet, but it's a great start and I love it. [Just get it down](https://darn.es/just-get-it-done/), something I read just today, captures this well. 


# Body
I have been heavily focused on taking care of my body. I started going to the gym regularly, worked on fixing my diet and sleep schedules, and the payoff has been marvelous. I also went to Himachal for a month in June for a Yoga course, to further that same quest. I am absolutely loving that, and I have reaped so much from it.
