## Third Place Venture Studio
I am currently building Third Place Venture Studio, my own little workshop for the ideas I want to test out. Everything I have done so far is under this banner, as well as my Freelance work. 
- Web development, for medium scale enterprises 
- Networking, IT infrastructure, backups, you name it, for the same

## On The Jungle Floor
On the jungle floor is a Vinyl Shop in Bangalore, one of the finest. They organise events and pop up stores, as well as have a physical setup to demo and sell records.
I was really fascinated by the idea of Vinyl, and really love Music, so I jumped at the chance to work there for a short while. It was also responsible for my moving to Bangalore for a short bit, which was a life changing decision that I am still reaping the benefits of. 
While I was there, I
- helped process records, and get them ready for sale
- helped manage the physical store, and process and ship online order
- helped organise the pop up displays at events
- researched for the future of the business and used my knowledge of Audio to help with sound

## Motojojo
A startup that organised House events in 18 cities with the aim of bringing people together over music and poetry.
- Was the Community Manager for Ahmedabad, organising and managing events.
- Anchored the events, making sure the guests had a good time and meshed well

I really enjoyed my time at Motojojo. We grew very fast, and I got to work with some really talented people. I also got to travel a lot and meet some amazing people. Working in front of an Audience regularly taught me crowdwork, improvisation, and how to think very fast. It was some of the most fun I had "working".


## Vrinsoft
(Dec 2019 - Jan 2021)
Vrinsoft was my first true "job". It was a software and web development company, and I initially joined there as a writer.  I started working there Part time, eventually joining full time. Covid ended my time there, but that job got me to write the most regularly I have ever written in my life, and taught me how to discipline myself very well. 


## Radio Nazariya
(Jan 2022 - Jul 2022)
Radio Nazariya is a community Radio station under Drishti Foundation in Ahmedabad, an organisation that works to promote the participation of people, espececially women, in local governance.
I was lucky enough to be a part of the team there, and facilitate and participate in the development of their fellowship program, during which
- Provided 1:1 mentoring and technical assistance to program fellows, supporting their community development and local governance initiatives.
- Assisted in the strategic planning and ideation of workshop modules, and helped set up exhibits and programs.
- Mentored fellows in developing unique interventions based on their art, theatre, poetry, and playwriting

It was a tremendous learning opportunity for me, where I first viscerally experienced intersectionality, and got to understand the nuances of community building and local governance. It also made me more appreaciative of the effectiveness of grassroots movements in creating change. One of the most important projects we accomplished at my time there was spurring the local Municipality into supplying proper water and sanitation to a locality that had been neglected for decades.
