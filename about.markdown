Hi, I am Rudra Kabir. I am an aspiring systems engineer, designer, writer, maker and builder. I want to build things and spaces to transform the way we think. I am based out of Ahmedabad. 


As a passionate and multidisciplinary creative, I thrive at the intersection of design, technology, and innovation. My journey in the world of creation began with a simple curiosity about how things work and has evolved into a deep-seated desire to shape the future through thoughtful design and impactful projects.


I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether you have a specific project in mind or just want to chat about design and innovation, I'd love to hear from you.

Feel free to reach out via email or Twitter.
