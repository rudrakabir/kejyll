My name is Rudra Kabir. I am a student, writer, designer and builder. At least, I want to be all those things, but I am still figuring all of that out. 

notes.rudrakabir.com exists as a subdomain where i keep my live drafts, so I have some incentive to keep working on them. 

The internet has given me everything I know, but I have not been giving anything back, so it doesn't know what else to give me now. This is my quest to do better.

I want to build things and spaces to transform the way we think. I am based out of Ahmedabad. 

My central belief is that the human mind is more flexible than we think, and I am scared that the way we are building our society is atrophying that flexibility. Use it, or lose it, and I sure as hell don't want to lose it. This website, and my life, is a project in exploring the limits of that flexibility.

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether you have a specific project in mind or just want to chat about design and innovation, I'd love to hear from you.

Feel free to reach out via email or Twitter.
