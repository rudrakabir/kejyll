Hi, I am Rudra Kabir. I am an aspiring systems engineer, designer, writer, maker and builder. I want to build things and spaces to transform the way we think. I am based out of Ahmedabad. 


My central belief is that the human mind is more flexible than we think, and I am scared that the way we are building our society is atrophying that flexibility. Use it, or lose it, and I sure as hell don't want to lose it. This website, and my life, is a project in exploring the limits of that flexibility.


I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether you have a specific project in mind or just want to chat about design and innovation, I'd love to hear from you.

Feel free to reach out via email or Twitter.
